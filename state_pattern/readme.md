This module contains an example of the state pattern.  This pattern is useful when you have an object with varying behavior that depends on its internal state.  Rather than use several if-else conditions (or something similar), a better approach is to define a state interface and instantiate concrete states for the possible states the object might be in.  Then the object just needs to maintain a single reference to its current state object.  In this module we have a gumball machine with 4 different states: when the gumball machine has no quarter, when there is a quarter, when the user has turned the crank (made a sale), and when the machine is sold out.  Each state implements a state interface with a few different methods for the possible actions the user might make.  Rather than having to constantly check what state the gumball machine is in, it simply tracks its current state and calls any needed methods on it.

This module contains a simple example of the singleton pattern.  The singleton pattern involves creating only a single instance of a class.  The example in this module is that of a chocolate boiler in a chocolate factory.  We only want one instance of the boiler since the factory only has one boiler, and we want to place restrictions as to when we can fill the boiler (it has to be empty), when we can boil it (it has to be full and not already boiling), and when we can empty it (it has to be full and boiling).  Scala provides an extremely easy way to implement/use the singleton pattern; all you have to do is use the "object" keyword instead of the "class" keyword.  If you were using a different language where this isn't the case, you could create a private instance within the class, instantiate that instance, and then return it in the constructor of the class (so that no new instances are ever created).

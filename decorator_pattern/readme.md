This module contains a basic example of the decorator pattern.  The idea of this pattern is to extend class functionality without changing any code within the class itself.  There is a beverage interface from which beverages inherit a single method, "cost" (for getting the base cost of the drink).  However, people often order condiments to go along with their drinks; rather than creating new subclasses of the beverage class for any possible combination of condiments (this would become very difficult to manage), we can create a decorator class that is also treated like a beverage, but represents a condiment.  We can then create sublcasses that represent the different condiments we need, wrap them with wrap any basic drinks, and calculate the new/custom cost for the customer.

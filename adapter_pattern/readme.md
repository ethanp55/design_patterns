This module contains an example of the adapter pattern.  This pattern is used when you want to be able to wrap the interface of one object around another.  In this example, there is a duck interface and a turkey interface; there is also a turkey adapter class that uses the duck interface so that you can create a turkey and use it as if it were a duck.

This module contains a basic example of the strategy pattern.  The idea of this pattern is to, within a class, separate static behavior from behavior that might vary (or not even exist) among subclasses.  In this example, the duck interface contains methods for flying and quacking, but sublclasses must implement these methods via their own fly and quack behavior classes.  These behaviors are also changeable, which makes the pattern flexible at runtime.

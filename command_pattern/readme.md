This module contains a basic example of the command pattern.  The idea behind the command pattern is to encapsulate actions/commands within an object so that they are easily executed.  This pattern also makes undoing actions easier than they would be otherwise.  An interface is used so that the caller of a command doesn't need to know what the command does or what type of command it is; it only needs to know how to run (or undo) the command.  In this module, a remote is used as the caller of commands.  It has two buttons for executing commands (and those buttons can be assigned an arbitrary command) and a single button for undoing the most recent action.

This module contains a basic example of the template pattern.  This pattern is useful if you have an algorithm with specific steps that you would like to maintain across different object instances, but perhaps change a few of the algorithm details depending on the instance.  For example, this module contains a CaffeineBeverage trait which contains the basic steps for preparing a hot drink.  There are 2 subclasses, Coffee and Tea, which extend this trait and change 2 of the steps (but maintain the order of the algorithm steps) to reflect their specific needs/differences.

This module contains a basic example of the facade design pattern.  The facade pattern is used to provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.  In this basic example there is a home theater facade which contains a popcorn popper, projector, and sound system.  When you want to watch a movie, rather than turn all of the different components on separately, the facade contains a single method called "watchMovie" that turns everything on for you.  Similarly, there is a method call "shutDown" that turns everything off once you're done watching.

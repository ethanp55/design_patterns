This module contains a basic example of the observer pattern.  The idea of this pattern is to have a central item (the "subject") notify any entities that rely on its information ("observers") whenever its internal state changes.  In this example, there is a weather data object that is the subject, which contains data about the current temperature, humidity, and pressure.  We also have a display object that is the observer (there's only one in this example, but you could add as many observers as needed), which relies on the information from the weather data object and displays the data in real time.  As such, whenever the information within the weather data object changes, the display object would like to know as soon as possible so that it can display the most up-to-date weather data.

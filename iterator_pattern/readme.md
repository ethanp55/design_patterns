This module contains a very basic implementation of the iterator pattern.  This pattern is useful when you have different collections that you would like to be able to iterate over in a central location without having to write different pieces of code for each collection.  In this module there are two different menus, one for a diner and one for a waffle house.  Suppose the two restaurants decide to merge together, but they implemented their menus differently: the diner used an array and the waffle house use a list.  Rather than creating two separate pieces of code for iterating through the menus, there is an iterator interface that the menus now use where they simply call iterator.next() to retrieve items from each menu.
